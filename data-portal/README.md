# ARDaC data portal

This is the code used to build the custom data portal for the ARDaC project. It is based on the [Gen3](https://gen3.org/) data commons platform and the standard "Windmill" [data portal](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal) as it existed circa 2022.

Notable features of this portal include:
- ARDaC branding and styling
- Customized data model
- Custom data visualization components in the Explore page (e.g. box plots)
