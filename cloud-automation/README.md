# Cloud automation

This directory contains files that are used for the old "cloud-automation" deployment method. This method is no longer recommended for new deployments, but it is still in use by some existing deployments.

## Deployment
For detailed steps about the cloud-automation deployment method, refer to the cloud-automation [README](../docs/cloud-automation.md) in the docs folder.

## Configuration files
The cdis-manifest folder contains directories for each environment. When deploying from an admin VM, copy or map this directory into your home folder in order to make Gen3 scripts work as expected.
