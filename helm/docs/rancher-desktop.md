# Instructions for deploying gen3-helm on Rancher Desktop

## Prerequesite

* Install https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation
* Once installed and started, review the Troubleshooting. Some warnings may cause problems later on
* Under Settings -> Virtual Machine Memory 16GB, 8 CPUs. During testing less memory caused the portal (webpack) build to fail

## Gen3 deployment
Clone the repository and install Gen3. A sample rancher-desktop-values.yaml file is included in the config folder of
this repo. It includes a locally build data-portal (windmill) and guppy. A similar pattern is applicable for other
services.
```
helm repo add gen3 http://helm.gen3.org
helm repo update

(Optional, search repos) helm search repo gen3

git clone https://github.com/Su-informatics-lab/ardac.git
git clone https://github.com/Su-informatics-lab/data-portal.git
git clone https://github.com/uc-cdis/guppy.git
docker build -t windmill data-portal/.
docker build -t guppy guppy/.
in gen3/gen3-helm:  helm upgrade --install dev ./helm/gen3 -f ../Su-informatics-lab/ardac/helm/config/rancher-desktop-values.yaml
```

The project will start up, this can be monitored and logs reviewed via k9s:
```
k9s

(Optional) Select a service, container and, for example, 0 to tail the log. It is normal to see containers re-try startup as dependencies start up
```

The elasticsearch deployment may fail with `max virtual memory areas` (as can be seen by tailing the logs per the
previous step) which will require the following steps (per
https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3-helm/blob/master/docs/gen3_developer_environments.md#elasticsearch-error). These
steps will make this change permanent until the repo is uninstalled.
```
rdctl shell
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
<go below the # comment line, press 'i' (for insert) and paste the following line with a newline at the end>
vm.max_map_count=262144
<type ':wq<enter>' to write and quit the editor>
sudo sysctl -p
exit
```

It may take 10-15 minutes for gen3 to start. Point your browser at http://localhost and bring up the Gen3 portal.
Note that you will see a browser warning about security.

## Gen3 restarting
Shut down and start up rancher will stop and start the dev deployment per the above instructions. Unfortunately 
elasticsearch will fail with the above error even though we persisted it. Follow these steps to bring it back:
```
rdctl shell
sudo sysctl -p
exit
```

## Creating a program and project

These steps are useful for preparing program and project data prior to submitting data.

* Go to https://localhost/_root and login
* Toggle Use Form Submission
* Select Program in the dropdown list
* Enter the below data, generate submission and submit
```
{
  "type": "program",
  "dbgap_accession_number": "phs1006",
  "name": "ARDaC"
}
```
* There will be no feedback on this form but if navigating to https://localhost/ARDaC is successful it worked
* Toggle Use Form Submission
* Select Project in the dropdown list
* Enter the below data, generate submission and submit
```
{
  "type": "project",
  "code": "AlcHepNet",
  "name": "AlcHepNet",
  "dbgap_accession_number": "phs1006"
}
```
* There will be a 200 / Submitted chunk 1 of 1 upon success of this submission. Projects can also be reviewed per https://localhost/api/search/datasets/projects
* Navigate to Submit Data (upper right) and note the program / project should display
* Select Submit data and upload files in the order of the hierarchy starting with study_node.tsv, make sure the program / project match with what was created above
  * study_node.tsv -> lab_node.tsv -> case_node.tsv -> demographic_node.tsv (optional: -> follow_up_node.tsv -> aliquot_node.tsv -> aliquot_node_part_2.tsv)

Now the ETL job needs to be started:
```
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/etl-cronjob etl
```

Verify the job for etl completes in k9s. You can also curl the indices on the elasticsearch endpoint. Like so (make sure
to replace the pod name with what is in k9s)

```
kubectl exec -it portal-deployment-74b89bd75f-r8lcc -- bash
curl -X GET http://gen3-elasticsearch-master:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

Now guppy can be started; first we need to fix a typo in gen3/gen3-helm/helm/guppy/templates/guppy_config.yaml, edit it, and replace these lines:

```
        {{- with .Values.configIndex }}
        "config_index": {{ . | quote }},
        {{- end }}
```

with this:

```
        "config_index": {{ .Values.configIndex | toJson }},
```
(16.Nov.2023: Alan and Philip are planning to report this)

now start guppy:

```
in gen3/gen3-helm/helm/guppy:  helm dependency update;helm dependency build
in gen3/gen3-helm:  helm upgrade --install guppy ./helm/guppy -f ../Su-informatics-lab/ardac/helm/config/rancher-desktop-values-guppy.yaml
```

## Gen3 uninstall

The persistent database needs to be uninstalled via a separate command.
```
helm uninstall guppy
helm uninstall dev
kubectl delete pvc gen3-elasticsearch-master-gen3-elasticsearch-master-0
kubectl delete pvc data-dev-postgresql-0
```

## (Use case) Deploy a code changes to guppy

This is an example scenario if a developer were to change source code in guppy and wants to deploy it:
```
in gen3/gen3-helm:  helm uninstall guppy
in gen3/Su-informatics-lab: docker build -t guppy guppy/.
in gen3/gen3-helm:  helm upgrade --install guppy ./helm/guppy -f ../Su-informatics-lab/ardac/helm/config/rancher-desktop-values-guppy.yaml
```

## Collection of useful commands
```
kubectl get configmaps
kubectl describe configmaps manifest-guppy
```

## Troubleshooting

### Elasticsearch deployment fail with `max virtual memory areas`

See vm.max_map_count for sysctl.conf instructions above.

### InvalidImageName

`stream logs failed container "ambassador" in pod "ambassador-deployment-58f48b8dc4-zq2kk" is waiting to start: InvalidImageName for ...`

Helm version > 3.12.3 is not supported. Note that rancher by default auto updates and resets this configuration on occasion.
1. Download https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.12.3 and unpack in an appropriate location
2. Update the symlink under .rd/bin/helm pointing to that version
3. Verify with `helm version`

### stream logs failed container "guppy" in pod "guppy-deployment-78cb9bf997-lkmjb" is waiting to start: ErrImageNeverPull for default/guppy-deployment-78cb9bf997-lkmjb (guppy)

Make sure that only rancher-desktop is running on your laptop, not a standalone version of Docker. rancher-desktop has its
own Docker daemon. Furthermore the steps where we build images needs to be done with the rancher-desktop Docker daemon,
otherwise the images will not be available. Finally verify the "Diagnostics" tab in rancher-desktop, it will verify
symlinks on your laptop point to the correct (rancher-desktop) Docker daemon. The symlinks being wrong will result in
messages such as Docker not running which should be the case if rancher-desktop is running.
